// we have FOUR features in the current stake program we care about:
// * stake_raise_minimum_delegation_to_1_sol / 9onWzzvCzNC2jfhxxeqRgs5q7nFAAKpCUvkj6T6GJK9i
//   this may or may not be activated by time we are done, but it should be confined to the program
//   so we use a placeholder for now to call it out but we can just change the program
// * reduce_stake_warmup_cooldown / GwtDQBghCTBgmX2cpEGNPxTEBUTQRaDMGTr5qychdGMj
//   this should be active by time we are done. this feature is in the runtime also
//   note that this is the feature that also eliminates stake config
//   we implement as if it were active
// * stake_redelegate_instruction / 2KKG3C6RBnxQo9jVVrbzsoSh41TDXLK7gBc9gduyxSzW
//   this is not active on any network and is unlikely to ever be activated
//   we do not implement it
// * require_rent_exempt_split_destination / D2aip4BBr8NPWtU9vLrwrBvbuaQ8w1zV38zFLxx4pfBV
//   this should be active by time we are done. its confined to the program
//   we use a placeholder to draw attention to it because its effects are rather tricky
